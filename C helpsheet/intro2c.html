            <h1>C Overview</h1>
            <h2>What is C?⁣ </h2>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Since the late 19th century, C has been a popular programming language for general-purpose use.</li>
                <li><span lang="EN-US">C language was developed by Dennis M.&nbsp;Ritchie at bell laboratory in early 1970s</span>⁣</li>
                <li>Its applications are very diverse. It ranges from developing operating systems to databases and all.⁣<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-US">It is system programming language used to do low level programming (e.g., driver or kernel)</span></li>
                <li>Even if it’s old, it is still a very popular programming language.⁣</li>
                <li>As the whole UNIX operating system was written in C, it has a strong association with the operating system⁣</li>
                <li>C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.⁣</li>
                <li>MySQL database is written using C.⁣</li>
                <li>Ruby and Pearl are mostly written using C.⁣</li>
                <li>Most part of Apache and NGINX is written using C.⁣</li>
                <li>Embedded Systems are created using C⁣</li>
                </ul></p>

            <h2>Why should we learn C/ Features of C?</h2>
            <p><ul>
                <li>As mentioned above, it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</li>
                <li>Learning any other popular programming language such as Python or C++ becomes a cakewalk already if you know C.</li>
                <li>C is a flexible language and that gets proven by the fact that it can be used in a variety of applications as well as technologies.</li>
                <li>C is very fast when compared to other programming languages be it Java or Python.</li>
                <li>C takes only significant CPU time for interpretation. That is why a lot of Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit-learn, etc. are built using C.</li>
                <li>Being close to Machine language, some of its functions include direct access to machine-level hardware APIs.</li>
                <li>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US" >It is a structural language (Follows a specific Structure) /Compiled language this point should be added</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US" >It is procedural programming language (POP) Procedural</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #202124; background: white;">l Programming is&nbsp;the use of code in a step-wise procedure to develop applications.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <h2>How is it different from C++?</h2>
            <p><ul>
                <li>The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.</li>
                <li>In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.</li>
                <li>C gives most of the control to the hand of users. Things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. Being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer because of which it is more efficient.</li>
                <li>
                <p>.C is POP(procedure oriented programming) whereas c++ is OOP(Object oriented programming)</p>
